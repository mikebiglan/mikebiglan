### Mike Biglan

Founder and CEO of **DevSwarm** — High-Velocity Engineering (HiVE) for real teams.  
Parallel AI assistants work in **branch-isolated** workspaces so you can explore more options, converge faster, and ship with confidence. Developers stay in control.

- Founder of **Twenty Ideas**, a 60-person product and technology studio in Oregon
- Previously **Head of Technology at Marco Polo**

**Focus areas**
- Developer productivity · multi-agent orchestration · secure dev environments  
- ML in production · humane, transparent AI

**Principles**
- High Velocity Engineering, or HiVE coding is how production-grade engineering is done. Speed without sacrifice
- Parallel is the serial killer; it beats serial when isolation, tests, and review keep it safe  
- Coder-in-the-loop. As AI continues to improve, the fundamental question is how us humans stay in control. What is our interface?

**Now**
- Building DevSwarm pilots with teams who want HiVE practices
- Instrumenting metrics that matter: lead time, PR throughput, change failure rate
